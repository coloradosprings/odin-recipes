        <h3>Discription</h3>
        <p>This homemade naan recipe makes soft, chewy naan with a buttery taste. It is the best I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. Simply delicious eaten warm brushed with melted butter or served with your favorite curry.</p>
        <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul><li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li></ul>
        <p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.
                </li>   
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
                </li>    
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.
                </li>    
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.
                </li>    
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
                </li>    
                <li><p>Step </p>
                    Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
                </li>    
                <li> <p>Step </p>
                    Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.
                </li>    
                <li> <p>Step </p>
                    Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.
                </li>    
                <li> <p>Step </p>
                    Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
